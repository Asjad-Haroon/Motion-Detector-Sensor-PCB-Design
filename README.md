# Motion-Detector-Sensor-PCB-Design
This repository contains PCB designs and schematics for a motion detector sensor using a relay and BJT (Bipolar Junction Transistor). The system detects motion using passive infrared (PIR) sensors and controls external devices (e.g., lights, alarms) through a relay-driven circuit. The design emphasizes sensitivity, reliability, and efficient power management.

Key Features:

Integration of PIR sensor for motion detection
BJT-based relay circuit for switching external devices
Adjustable sensitivity and delay settings
Low-power design for prolonged operation
Compact and optimized PCB layout for easy integration
